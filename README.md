# Sequence

Sequence is a MIDI sequencer designed to run on a headless computer (e.g. a Raspberry Pi), using a USB MIDI controller 
(e.g. a Novation Launchpad) for the UI. It is being developed on a Raspberry Pi and Launchpad (original, not an S, RGB, or Pro)
but should be adaptable to other hardware.
